= rails-translate-models

Minimal implementation of model translations for Rails 3.x having a translations table for each model, based on translated_attributes.

== Installation

Add it to your Gemfile:

  gem 'rails-translate-models'

== Setting up

All examples provided will be based on an article model with title and body as translated attributes.

<b>Migration</b>

For each model you have to create a table for the translations, you can do it on model migration, for example:

  class CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table :articles do |t|
        t.timestamps
      end

      create_table :article_translations do |t|
        t.integer    :article_id
        t.string     :language_code
        t.string     :title
        t.text       :body
        t.timestamps
      end

      add_index :article_translations, [:article_id, :language_code], :unique => true
    end
  end

<b>Specify translated attributes in model</b>

  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_translations :title, :body
  end

== Usage

Self-explained usage given an article with two translations (en / es)

Retrieve data, english as current language:

  a = Article.first
  a.title
  => "example title"

Change language and you'll get in spanish

  I18n.locale = :es
  a.title
  => "título ejemplo"

Or you can also get any other language using in_language_code for each attribute

  a.title_in_en
  => "example title"

Note that if the current language doesn't have a translation it always tries to fallback to english then returns nil if it's also not available.

To create a new object.

  a = Article.new
  a.title = "example title"
  a.title_in_es = "título ejemplo"
  a.save

When translation associated record is destroyed all translations are destroyed as well

== Scopes

All models with 'has_translations' have 'has_many :model_translations' and 'default_scope :include => :model_translations' so you can take advantage of it and make use of some scopes, for example:

  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_translations :title, :body

    scope :ordered_by_title, :order => 'article_translations.title'
    scope :with_title, lambda { |title| where("article_translations.title = ?", title) }
  end

== TODO

It's an initial implementation for a work in progress project, it's just an initial release but does the basic stuff I need. Help is welcome ;)

* make tests
* translations models generators
